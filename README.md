## Data Analytics Project
# Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, covering data loading, exploration, cleaning, analysis using SQL, and visualization through an interactive dashboard. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from raw data and present them clearly for business decision-making.

# Dataset

The dataset contains structured data relevant to business/operational analysis.

Data was loaded and processed using Python.

Key issues handled include missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formats.

(Note: Dataset details can be updated here based on the actual data source.)

## Tools & Technologies

# Python – Data loading, cleaning, and EDA

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

# SQL – Data querying and analysis

PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server

Power BI – Interactive dashboard and visualizations

Gamma – Presentation (PPT) creation

Jupyter Notebook – Analysis and documentation

## Project Steps

# Data Loading

Imported dataset into Python using Pandas.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed data structure, distributions, and relationships.

Identified trends, outliers, and anomalies.

# Data Cleaning

Handled missing values and duplicates.

Standardized column names and data formats.

# SQL Analysis

Loaded cleaned data into a relational database.

Executed SQL queries to answer key business questions.

# Dashboard Creation

Built an interactive Power BI dashboard for insights.

# Reporting & Presentation

Documented findings in a report.

Created a professional PPT using Gamma.

## Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard includes:

Key metrics and KPIs

Trend analysis and comparisons

Filters for dynamic exploration

(Screenshots or dashboard link can be added here.)

## Results & Insights

Identified important patterns and trends in the data.

Provided actionable insights to support decision-making.

Presented findings in a clear, visual, and business-friendly manner.

## How to Run the Project
